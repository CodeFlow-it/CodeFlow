# Developer Guide: Best Practices for Code Versioning and Commit Management

## 1. Branch Naming Conventions
   - **Feature Branches**: Prefix with `feat/`, followed by a short descriptive name. 
     - Example: `feat/login-authentication`
   - **Bugfix Branches**: Prefix with `fix/`, followed by a short description of the bug.
     - Example: `fix/header-responsive-issue`
   - **Documentation**: Prefix with `docs/`, followed by a brief description.
     - Example: `docs/update-readme`

## 2. Committing Changes
   - **Small, Focused Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change. 
   - **Descriptive Messages**: Write clear, concise commit messages that explain the what and why of the commit.

## 3. Using Commitizen for Standardized Commit Messages (only for front-end developers)
   - **Installation**: Instructions on installing Commitizen.
   - **Usage**: How to use Commitizen to create commits.
     - Run `git cz` instead of `git commit`.
     - Follow the prompts to fill in the commit fields (type, scope, subject, body, etc.).

## 4. Examples of Good Commit Messages
   - **Feature Commit**: `feat(auth): add user authentication module`
   - **Bug Fix Commit**: `fix(header): correct responsive display issue`
   - **Documentation Commit**: `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

## 5. Code Reviews and Merging
   - **Pull Requests**: Create a pull request for merging into the main branch.
   - **Code Review Process**: Outline the process for reviewing code before it is merged.

## 6. Additional Best Practices
   - **Regular Pulls from Main Branch**: Keep your branch up to date with the main branch.
   - **Conflict Resolution**: Tips on resolving merge conflicts.
